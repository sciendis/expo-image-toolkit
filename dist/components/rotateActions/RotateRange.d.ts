/**
 * @description This component and the `useMoveRotateRangeBar` hook were originally used to render a range bar
 * and let users rotate the image at any angle. Now, it only shows the current angle, since the range bar
 * is disabled for now due to the current cropFrame calculation and limitations of the older version of imageManipulator.
 *
 * I kept the original name because I want to bring back full-angle rotation later as a new feature. I think
 * itâ€™ll be possible with the new version of imageManipulator after updating Expo to 52.
